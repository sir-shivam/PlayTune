# in this project I have used React, NodeJs and MongoDb  

This is my latest code  for Task 3 of the Delta Inductions 2024 (Web development).
https://github.com/sir-shivam/DeltaWeb-Task3  

# Setup

### 1. Clone the repository
Clone the **main** branch of this repo into your folder

2. I have used MongoDb Atlas (Link is already Applied in the code)

### 2. I am Using MongoDb Atlas 
mongoDb Atlas online version

### 3. Open seperate terminals for client and react folders
From the main repo folder, cd backend and cd front-end in different terminals

### 4. for seting up Backend 
   Move to backend file in terminal using
   ```
   cd backend
   ```

   Install all required package.json by using 
   ```
   npm install
   ``` 

   Start the Backend Client by running "nodemon" in terminal
   ```
   nodemon
   ```

   This will start backend Terminal on local host 4000 
   if you want to change the local host ====>   backend >  index.js > change the "port" value

### 4. For setting up frontend File 

    Move to front-end file in new terminal using
   ```
   cd front-end
   ```

   Install all required package.json by using 
   ```
   npm install
   ``` 

   Start the Backend by running "npm start" in terminal
   ```
   npm start
   ```

   this will automatically start the front-end at local host 3000

   if you have changed the backend local host then **update** in   front-end > src > utils > confg.jsx   file


## important Note 
   1. I have deployed backend on render  and its URL is commented in config.js file  which is in path "/front-end/src/utils/config.js"
   2. it can be used instead of local host 4000

##  The web app is up and running!! , Enjoy the Song

### In Future you can simply run 

   1. "nodemon" in backend file and
   2. "npm start" in forntend file
